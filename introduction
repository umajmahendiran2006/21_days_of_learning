today i have learned some built in  and library functions.
built-in funtions:
    which makes code easier ,like we can use this which was already predefined.
    example:input()->to get input from user,len()->to find lenghth,min->to find the small number...
library:
    it is also prefined but to initialize this we have to import it .
    example:math->to find sqrt of a number,factorial,trigonometry funtion like sin,cos,tan,cmath to find complex number....
and finally end with by checking palindrome or not
